# Rails ActionCable Chat Application

* rails version 5.2

Just a quick chat application using ActionCable. This was made entirely for educational purposes, I wanted to better understand how to use ActionCable. The devise gem is used for the user authentication, and bootstrap4 was used for styling.

I currently have some logic in the views, which I understand is frowned upon. I do plan on creating helper methods in the future.

Feedback appreciated! I'm new to this.
